# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Path for Capstone Project from Team CH2-PS278 of Bangkit 2023 Batch 2, Recipefy App development and documentation repository.
# Introduction
Our multifaceted app is a comprehensive solution for culinary enthusiasts, students, and
budget-conscious individuals seeking a seamless cooking experience. This app is designed to revolutionize home cooking, offering convenience, efficiency, and culinary creativity all in one package.
# Recommendation System
Collaborative filtering works by filtering items that could capture a user's interest, using the responses of other users as a basis. This method scans a large population to find users with preferences similar to those of a particular user.

On the other hand, content-based recommendation systems treat the recommendation process as a classification problem tailored to each user. The system learn what a user likes or dislikes by focusing on an item's characteristics. In this approach, items are described using keywords, and a user profile is established to determine the type of items that the user tends to prefer.
# Ingredients Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. This process not only classifies objects but also provides their precise locations in the form of bounding boxes.  Object detection has wide-ranging applications, from self-driving cars to security surveillance and face recognition. It plays a crucial role in enabling computers to understand and interact with the visual world.
# Recipe Recommendation Feature
Recipefy seeks to help user who have different taste of food. User can use Recipefy to  get recommendations for food based on the ingredients and their favorite.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this application userefrences from kaggle and Github for our Recommendation System. We also use other refrence of dataset which has similar with our ideas flow to test the object detection models for getting Ingredients Object Detection.
